    <strong>The mission of Memento Mori is to normalize grief.</strong> Even though grief is a universal human experience that will eventually impact us all (if it hasn't already), there are very few everday avenues to publicly express grief.

    In 2022, I lost my dad to suicide. Over night, I inadvertently became an advocate for suicide prevention, mental illness, and grief. While navigating my own grieving process, however, I often found that I felt uncomfortable expressing my grief around others. I longed for an avenue where I could freely express the weight of carrying such a massive loss with me every day. I wanted to know my grief <strong>mattered</strong> in the world.

    Over time, I noticed something interesting. The one place where I felt I could go to make my grief known was social media. In between the banal Instagram posts of sunsets, lattes, and #ootds, I would post notes addressed to my dead dad. Even though I'm fairly certain my dad isn't actually reading my posts, addressing captions to him met a very ancient impulse to commune with the departed. I began noticing notes addressed to dead loved ones across my social media feeds and realized we were all scratching that very same human itch.
